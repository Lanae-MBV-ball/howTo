    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Bible is the base to every "TRUE" Christian's faith. Most people aren't real Christians, so that's why I put true in quotes. Christianity is hard, selfless, and forgiving. If you are doubting your faith and/or going through a hard time in life, these steps to reading the bible will help.</p>

        <p>Follow the steps below to learn how to read the bible efectively and find some insperational verses/chapters.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Start out with just picking up your bible, (a trusted version mine is ESV, but I also use others to cross reference.) and flipping to a random page, read the verse, or whole chapter. You wont likely flip to somthing that speaks to you, but that's ok!</li>
            <li>Use a plan to keep focused on your need. You could also look up 'Bible verses to help with ___' fill in the blank, and the internet will bring up verses other people thought were helpful.</li>
            <li>Pray before you read. Ask God to help you understand what you are reading and how it applies to your life (Because it always does, not matter if we understand or not.).</li>
            <li>Take notes. Write down any verses that stand out to you, or any thoughts you have while reading.</li>
            <li>Get a journal for your prayers and write them out. This will help you get your thoughs out in a physical form. It also means you have a record for the future to read, incase you go through this time again, or if you have gotten father in your faith.</li>
            <li>Apply what you read. Try to live out the lessons you learn from the Bible in your daily life. But always remember, you are human, like the rest of us, so you will make mistakes, it's what you do afte that matters.</li>
            <li>Be consistent. Make reading the Bible a regular part of your routine, whether it's daily, weekly, or whatever works for you at first. After a while try to do more and more everyday.</li>
            <li>Join a Bible study or small group. This can provide support, accountability, and different perspectives on the scriptures. If your perspective is different, or wrong, don't get discuraged, your growing.</li>
            <li>Don't be afraid to ask questions. If you come across something you don't understand, seek out answers from trusted people like pastors, Christian mentors, your church elders, or reputable Christian websites, but always pray for wisdom.</li>
            <li>Remember that reading the Bible is a journey. It's okay if you don't understand everything right away, or even ever. Keep reading, praying, and seeking God, and He will reveal His plan for you in His timing.</li>
        </ol>
